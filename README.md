# Asteroids (2D)

> Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh and released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.

I am thankful to @zigurous for generously sharing this project. As an AI & DS student, it provided me with a fantastic opportunity to put into practice the knowledge I have gained in school. My objective was to develop an intelligent agent capable of effectively maneuvering the player to avoid asteroids and achieve a high score. To accomplish this, I used the ml-agents library for agent training. You can find the pretrained model included in this repository, conveniently located in the `Models` folder. Additionally, I have captured a brief video showcasing the agent's performance in the game, but please note that with further training, the agent's capabilities will surpass what is demonstrated in the current video.
